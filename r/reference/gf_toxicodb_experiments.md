# One gene's ToxicoDB expression under one compound: every sample by dose (Control, Low, Middle, High:...

One gene's ToxicoDB expression under one compound: every sample by dose
(Control, Low, Middle, High: categorical labels, not concentrations) and
time (h), for one dataset x cell panel at a time (panels are never
pooled). figure_kind=time_course draws time on x with one line per dose
and every replicate as a point; dose_box draws boxes by dose at each
time. Values are ToxicoDB's processed expression, unchanged. In vitro
hepatocyte and hepatoma material only. Latency: 1-20 s.

## Arguments

- session:

  A GeneFox session from
  [`gf_session`](https://genefox.app/r/reference/gf_client.md).

- compound:

  (string) Compound name, PubChem CID, or toxicodb:\<id\>.

- gene:

  (string) Gene symbol, Ensembl gene id, Entrez id, or toxicodb:\<id\>.

- cell:

  (string, optional) Cell within the dataset (Hepatocyte, Hep-G2,
  HepaRG). NULL omits it.

- center:

  (string, optional; one of "median", "mean"; default "median")
  Time-course line center per dose and time. NULL omits it.

- csv:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Also write the screen's CSV export
  (the app's own rows) under the output directory and return csv.path.
  NULL omits it.

- dataset:

  (string, optional) ToxicoDB dataset name: Open TG-GATEs Human, Open
  TG-GATEs Rat, DrugMatrix Rat or EMEXP2458. Default: the first panel
  returned. NULL omits it.

- dpi:

  (integer, optional; default 300; range 72..1200) Resolution of a
  custom size (at most 8,192 px a side and 16 MP). NULL omits it.

- figure:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Draw the figure and return its PNG
  path. NULL omits it.

- figure_kind:

  (string, optional; one of "time_course", "dose_box"; default
  "time_course") Which figure to draw. NULL omits it.

- format:

  (string, optional; one of "png", "svg", "tiff"; default "png") Figure
  format: png (raster, default), svg (vector with editable text), or
  tiff (raster, .tif); one per run. NULL omits it.

- height_in:

  (number, optional; range 1..40) Custom figure height in inches (with
  the other side; instead of size). The app's size control range. NULL
  omits it.

- html:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Write the screen's single-figure
  HTML export under the output directory and return html.path. Requires
  figure. NULL omits it.

- inline_image:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Include PNG MCP image content up to
  1,048,576 bytes; larger files stay on disk and disclose
  inline_image_omitted. NULL omits it.

- outline_text:

  (boolean, optional; default false) With format svg, write labels as
  glyph outlines instead of editable text. Refused with other formats.
  NULL omits it.

- output_name:

  (string, optional) Optional figure name replacing tool and title slug:
  up to 64 letters, digits, '.', '\_' or '-'; starts alphanumeric, no
  '..'. Session number, size and extension remain; collisions get -2,
  -3, etc. NULL omits it.

- show_caption_color_keys:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: a table caption
  carries the sentence explaining the figure's colors. NULL omits it.

- show_figure_legends:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: the figure draws its
  own legend. NULL omits it.

- show_row_counts:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: a box plot's row
  labels carry each group's n. NULL omits it.

- size:

  (string, optional; one of "single_column", "one_and_a_half_column",
  "double_column", "slide", "poster"; default "double_column") Figure
  size preset (the app's export presets); double_column is the app
  default. NULL omits it.

- species:

  (string, optional; one of "human", "rat") Gene species; needed when a
  symbol exists in both. NULL omits it.

- survival_detail:

  (string, optional; one of "none", "inference", "inferenceAndEffect",
  "full"; default "inferenceAndEffect") Figure style: how much of a
  Kaplan-Meier findings block to draw (the app's Figure Style setting).
  NULL omits it.

- survival_median_lines:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Figure style: draw dashed median
  survival guides for reached medians. NULL omits it.

- width_in:

  (number, optional; range 1..40) Custom figure width in inches (with
  the other side; instead of size). The app's size control range. NULL
  omits it.

- progress_callback:

  Optional function receiving runtime progress events; NULL disables
  progress.

## Value

A `gf_result` holding the engine payload, provenance and owned figures
for the `toxicodb_experiments` tool. The runtime validates every
argument and refuses tools absent from its
[`gf_tools()`](https://genefox.app/r/reference/gf_client.md) list.
Result contract:
<https://genefox.app/schemas/v1/toxicodb-experiments-result-v1.schema.json>.
