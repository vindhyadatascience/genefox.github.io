One GDC case's whole-transcriptome RNA-seq (STAR counts), as GeneFox's
case Expression tab shows it: genes ranked by TPM, FPKM or counts
(search by symbol, Ensembl id or biotype; at most 500 rows), the top 20
protein-coding genes and their ranked-bar figure. Latency: 3-15 s (a ~4
MB file), then instant for the same case. The figure is the app's case
Expression tab PNG export.

  "WCDT-MCRPC") TCGA/TARGET/other GDC project id with a GDC Xena
  expression dataset, e.g. TCGA-BRCA.

- dpi:

  (integer, optional; default 300; range 72..1200) Resolution of a
  custom size (at most 8,192 px a side and 16 MP). NULL omits it.

- figure:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Draw the figure and return its PNG
  path. NULL omits it.

- format:

  (string, optional; one of "png", "svg", "tiff"; default "png") Figure
  format: png (raster, default), svg (vector with editable text), or
  tiff (raster, .tif); one per run. NULL omits it.

- height_in:

  (number, optional; range 1..40) Custom figure height in inches (with
  the other side; instead of size). The app's size control range. NULL
  omits it.

- html:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Write the screen's single-figure
  HTML export under the output directory and return html.path. Requires
  figure. NULL omits it.

- inline_image:

  (boolean, optional; default false) Include PNG MCP image content up to
  1,048,576 bytes; larger files stay on disk and disclose
  inline_image_omitted. NULL omits it.

- limit:

  (integer, optional; default 500; range 1..500) Rows of the ranked
  table to return (the screen shows 500). NULL omits it.

- metric:

  (string, optional; one of "tpm", "fpkm", "counts"; default "tpm") The
  metric the table and figure rank by (the screen's picker; TPM is its
  default). NULL omits it.

- outline_text:

  (boolean, optional; default false) With format svg, write labels as
  glyph outlines instead of editable text. Refused with other formats.
  NULL omits it.

- output_name:

  (string, optional) Optional figure name replacing tool and title slug:
  up to 64 letters, digits, '.', '\_' or '-'; starts alphanumeric, no
  '..'. Session number, size and extension remain; collisions get -2,
  -3, etc. NULL omits it.

- search:

  (string, optional) Filter the table by gene symbol, Ensembl id or
  biotype (case-insensitive substring), as the screen's search field.
  NULL omits it.

- show_caption_color_keys:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: a table caption
  carries the sentence explaining the figure's colors. NULL omits it.

- show_figure_legends:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: the figure draws its
  own legend. NULL omits it.

- show_row_counts:

  (boolean, optional; default true) Figure style: a box plot's row
  labels carry each group's n. NULL omits it.

- size:

  (string, optional; one of "single_column", "one_and_a_half_column",
  "double_column", "slide", "poster"; default "double_column") Figure
  size preset (the app's export presets); double_column is the app
  default. NULL omits it.

- survival_detail:

  (string, optional; one of "none", "inference", "inferenceAndEffect",
  "full"; default "inferenceAndEffect") Figure style: how much of a
  Kaplan-Meier findings block to draw (the app's Figure Style setting).
  NULL omits it.

  (boolean, optional; default false) Figure style: draw dashed median
  survival guides for reached medians. NULL omits it.

- width_in:

  (number, optional; range 1..40) Custom figure width in inches (with

  omits it.

- progress_callback:

  Optional function receiving runtime progress events; NULL disables
  progress.

## Value

A `gf_result` holding the engine payload, provenance and owned figures
for the `tcga_case_expression` tool. The runtime validates every
argument and refuses tools absent from its
[`gf_tools()`](https://genefox.app/r/reference/gf_client.md) list.
Result contract:
<https://genefox.app/schemas/v1/tcga-case-expression-result-v1.schema.json>.
